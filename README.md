### UPDATE(2020-01-12)

Note that this project is obsolete and the pure VB6 inflate is very inefficient and not suitable for production use.

For efficient production grade VB6+ASM zlib deflate/inflate implementation check out the single-class  [ZipArchive](https://github.com/wqweto/ZipArchive) repo.


## VB6 Unzip Class
This is a pure VB6 class for extracting zip archives with no dependency on other libraries or modules.

Based on [\_+Compression Methods+\_ V 1.04](https://github.com/Planet-Source-Code/marco-v-d-berg-compression-methods-v-1-04__1-37867) by Marco v/d Berg and optimizations by John Korejwa.

Original code is completely refactored to be wrapped in a self-containing class module.
